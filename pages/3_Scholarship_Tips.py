    "Proofread everything twice! Typos and grammatical errors can get your application disqualified immediately.",
    "Don't neglect smaller, local scholarships. They often have significantly less competition.",
    "Showcase your unique personality and story in your essays, not just a list of your achievements.",
    "Request strong letters of recommendation from teachers or mentors who know you well and can speak to your strengths.",
    "Highlight your volunteer work and community service to show you are a well-rounded candidate.",
    "Create a detailed timeline with all your deadlines in a calendar to stay organized and avoid last-minute stress.",
    "Never pay to apply for a scholarship. Legitimate scholarship opportunities are always free.",
    "Apply for scholarships even if you don't think you perfectly meet every single requirement. You might be surprised!"
